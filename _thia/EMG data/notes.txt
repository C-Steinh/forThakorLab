This EMG data was collected from a transhumeral (left) amputee (male, 29 y.o.)

You want to look at the 'Processed_Training_data_Sub1.mat' files.

The EMG features from each electrode (there are 3 for each electrode) are in the 'output.X' array of each file. The 'output.L' vector is the corresponding grasp label.

The subject performed 14 grip classes. Each grasp is held and the features recorded (and stored) for 3 seconds. Each grasp is presented once in every file. There were 3 trials...so each grasp was performed 3 times.

The features for each electrode are:

1. Electrode 1: Mean Absolute Value
2. Electrode 1: Variance
3. Electrode 1: Waveform Length


4. Electrode 2: Mean Absolute Value
5. Electrode 2: Variance
6. Electrode 2: Waveform Length


The Labels are numbered from 1 through 15. They are:

1. Hand Open
2. Hand Close
3. Supinate
4. Pronate
5. Index Point
6. Tripod Grip
7. Rest
8. Wrist Extend
9. Wrist Flex
10. Key Grip
11. Ulnar Deviation
12. Radial Deviation
13. Thumb to Pinky
14. Precision Open
15. Precision Closed
